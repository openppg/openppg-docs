### Electric SP140 OpenPPG Paramotor Warranty

At OpenPPG, we’re passionate about building paramotors and want you to have the most fun possible without worrying about engine maintenance, repairs, or tuning the motor. This is why we are such big fans of electric systems. However, no system is perfect, so we also include a generous warranty on top of the highly reliable system.

We take pride in our work and want you to feel great about your purchase. That’s why we offer this warranty to cover you for 12 months or 300 hours of operation, giving you a solid foundation for your adventures.

#### What is Covered:
This warranty covers any defects in materials or workmanship in all parts of your paramotor, including the motor power system and battery, under normal use and service. If something goes wrong due to an error on our part, we’ll make it right.

#### Warranty Period:
The warranty lasts for 300 hours of operation or 12 months from the date of delivery, whichever comes first. We are able to provide this warranty because unlike internal combustion paramotors, which require regular maintenance and rebuilds, electric paramotors do not. That’s why the SP140 comes with an industry-first 1-year/300-hour warranty, while many others offer little to no warranty.

#### What is Not Covered:
We want to be totally open about what this warranty doesn’t cover, so there are no surprises:
- Damage caused by accidents, crashes, or collisions
- Damage from misuse, abuse, or neglect
- Damage due to major modifications or unauthorized repairs
- Normal wear and tear
- Damage from improper maintenance or not following our recommended maintenance steps
- Use of the paramotor in ways or conditions outside normal paramotor flying
- Any issues from not following safety guidelines or regulations

In short, if it’s a defect from how we built it, we’ve got your back. But if it’s from a crash, misuse, or big mods you’ve made, that’s not part of this warranty.

#### Beyond the Warranty:
Here’s the thing—we don’t just stop caring once the warranty ends. For many of our customers, we’re still supporting them even after the 300 hours or 12 months are up. We had to set a specific cutoff to give you something solid to rely on, but we’re in this for the long haul. Plus, we take pride in keeping replacement parts affordable and in stock, so you can keep flying without breaking the bank.

#### Making a Warranty Claim:
If you run into a problem we’ve covered, just get in touch with us at [info@openppg.com](mailto:info@openppg.com). Show us your proof of purchase and tell us what’s going on. We’ll check it out, and if it’s under warranty, we’ll repair or replace the defective part(s) at no cost to you—parts and labor included.

#### Limitations:
- This warranty is for you, the original purchaser—it’s not transferable.
- Openppg.com decides if a part is defective and whether we’ll repair or replace it.
- This warranty is not for the ICE SP140 as we do not manufacture the motor in that case, and that warranty is with the manufacturer Vittorazi.
- This warranty applies to the complete OpenPPG paramotors; it does not include standalone, individual parts procured separately for systems used outside compatible OpenPPG parts.
- Shipping cost not included, warranty covers all labor costs and replacement part costs; owners are responsible for getting warranty parts to the repair facility.
- This new warranty goes into effect for all paramotors received starting February 1st, 2025 and onward.
