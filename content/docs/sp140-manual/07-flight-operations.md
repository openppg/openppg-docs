## 7.1 Normal Flight Profile
The SP140 electric paramotor operates on the same principle as any other gas paramotor, spinning the propeller to produce thrust so it can be flown similarly to most other paramotors.

**Takeoff:**
While no warm-up is needed, it's still a good idea to spin up the propeller and ensure there are no impediments to a smooth takeoff. Pilots tend to be focused on the takeoff once the wing is overhead, so it's best to confirm everything will operate as expected.

**Climb-out:**
During climb-out and under full power, always ensure there's a safe landing area at any point in case of motor or wing problems. Also, check the hand controller's screen for system alerts before they reach a critical state. It's designed to give a heads-up well in advance to avoid surprises.

**In flight:**
When settled into cruise flight, always be aware of your surroundings, watch out for other aircraft, and monitor any developing weather. Also, check the hand controller's screen to monitor the flight system's status and remaining energy. Your hand controller will vibrate to notify you of any warnings or alerts, along with displaying the information on the screen. Always fly in a manner that if a motor out occurred, you would always have a safe glide to a landing spot.

**Landing:**
Many pilots choose to disarm the throttle on landing to prevent accidental activation when on the ground; this is a personal preference.

## 7.2 Post-Landing Shutdown

**Post flight:**
After flight, turn off the main power switch located on the battery pack. Then, unplug the main power lead from the motor. Note the battery's SOC percentage. If landing with an SOC below 10%, it's best to charge the battery back to around 50% SOC before storing the system for longer than a week.
