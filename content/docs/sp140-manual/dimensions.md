## Dimensions

### Assembled (Ready to Fly)

**Size when assembled ready to fly**: 610 x 1520 x 1520mm

- **Width**: 1520mm (including protective cage)
- **Height**: 1520mm (frame to top of hoop)
- **Depth**: 610mm (front to back)

### Shipping / Transport

**Shipping / Transport size**: 580 x 400 x 420mm

The SP140 v2.5 disassembles for compact storage and transportation:

- **Length**: 580mm
- **Width**: 400mm
- **Height**: 420mm

This compact size allows for easy transport in most vehicles and fits in standard cargo areas.

## Weight Distribution

Understanding weight distribution helps with:
- Transport planning
- Storage solutions
- Vehicle compatibility
- Balance considerations

### Component Weights

- **Frame Assembly**: ~29 lbs (13.2 kg)
- **Battery (2.6 kWh)**: 25.8 lbs (11.7 kg)
- **Battery (4.8 kWh)**: 49.0 lbs (22.2 kg)
- **Propeller**: ~2 lbs (0.9 kg)

## Clearance Requirements

### Operating Clearance

When operating, ensure:
- **Front**: 2m (6.5 ft) clear space for propeller
- **Sides**: 1m (3.3 ft) each side
- **Rear**: 1m (3.3 ft) behind pilot

### Storage Clearance

For storage (disassembled):
- **Floor Space**: 60 x 45 cm (24 x 18 in)
- **Height**: 150 cm (5 ft) for vertical storage
- **Access**: Allow space for assembly/disassembly

## Transport Guidelines

### Vehicle Requirements

The disassembled SP140 fits in:
- Standard car trunks
- SUV cargo areas
- Van interiors
- Truck beds
- Roof cargo carriers (with weather protection)

### Packaging

When transporting:
1. **Battery**: Keep in foam case, upright or on side (never upside down)
2. **Frame**: Can be bundled together
3. **Propeller**: Store separately in protective case
4. **Electronics**: Keep dry and protected from impact

See [After-Flight Care](../after-flight) for detailed transport instructions.

## Customization

The open-source CAD files allow you to:
- Design custom accessories
- Create mounting solutions
- Develop third-party add-ons
- Modify for specific needs
