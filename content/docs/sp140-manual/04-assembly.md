1. There are 7 total hoop connectors 0-6. Start by looking at the motor size of the frame (backside) starting from the bottom left CF spar with the number 1 labeled connector.
2. Slide firmly over the CF spar you should feel it bottom out and not be able to side further on. You can confirm this with a light tap of a hammer but please be careful not to hit the edges of the connector as they are more fragile.

## 4.5 Netting

1. Start by taking the 7 hoop profiles out and sliding onto one section of the connectors, this will allow a simple structure for the netting to slide into place.
2. Now take the netting out of the bag and count over 6 sections of the netting rod from an end point that will be the middle point to start from. There are 12 total netting rods.

## 4.6 Gooseneck bar assembly

1. Take your goose neck bars out of protective packaging and then decide which direction you want the torque compensation to be on.  For the standard SP140 electric motor direction, it will be on the right side of the goose neck bars when in the flying position.  For the ICE Atom 80, it should be placed on the left side.
