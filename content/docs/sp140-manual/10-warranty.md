## Electric SP140 OpenPPG Paramotor Warranty

At OpenPPG, we're passionate about building paramotors and want you to have the most fun possible without worrying about engine maintenance, repairs, or tuning the motor. This is why we are such big fans of electric systems. However, no system is perfect, so we also include a generous warranty on top of the highly reliable system.

We take pride in our work and want you to feel great about your purchase. That's why we offer this warranty to cover you for **12 months or 300 hours of operation**, giving you a solid foundation for your adventures.

## What is Covered

This warranty covers any defects in materials or workmanship in all parts of your paramotor, including the motor power system and battery, under normal use and service. If something goes wrong because of a mistake on our end, we'll make it right.

### Covered Components

- **Frame and structural components**
- **Motor and motor controller (ESC)**
- **Battery pack and BMS**
- **Hand controller**
- **Propeller and mounting hardware**
- **Harness components**
- **All electrical connections**
- **Included accessories**

## Warranty Period

The warranty lasts for **300 hours of operation OR 12 months from the date of delivery**, whichever comes first.

We are able to provide this warranty because unlike internal combustion paramotors, which require regular maintenance and rebuilds, electric paramotors do not. That's why the SP140 comes with an **industry-first 1-year/300-hour warranty**, while many others offer little to no warranty.

### Why This Warranty is Possible

Electric motors have:
- No oil to change
- No spark plugs to replace
- No carburetor to tune
- No compression rings to wear
- No exhaust system to maintain
- Minimal moving parts

This reliability allows us to offer comprehensive coverage.

## What is NOT Covered

We want to be totally open about what this warranty doesn't cover, so there are no surprises:

### Excluded from Coverage

- **Damage caused by accidents, crashes, or collisions**
- **Damage from misuse, abuse, or neglect**
- **Damage due to major modifications or unauthorized repairs**
- **Normal wear and tear**
- **Damage from improper maintenance** or not following our recommended maintenance steps
- **Use of the paramotor in ways or conditions outside normal paramotor flying**
- **Any issues from not following safety guidelines or regulations**

**In short**: If it's a defect from how we built it, we've got your back. But if it's from a crash, misuse, or big mods you've made, that's not part of this warranty.

### Examples of Non-Covered Damage

**Crashes and Impacts:**
- Propeller damage from ground strikes
- Frame damage from crashes
- Battery damage from impacts

**Misuse:**
- Operating outside temperature specifications
- Overloading beyond rated capacity
- Using incompatible components

**Modifications:**
- Unauthorized electrical modifications
- Structural changes to frame
- Use of non-approved batteries or chargers

**Wear Items:**
- Propeller edge wear
- Harness strap wear
- Netting degradation from UV exposure
- Battery capacity fade from normal use

## Beyond the Warranty

Here's the thing—we don't just stop caring once the warranty ends. For many of our customers, we're still supporting them even after the 300 hours or 12 months are up. We had to set a specific cutoff to give you something solid to rely on, but **we're in this for the long haul**.

Plus, we take pride in keeping replacement parts super affordable and in stock, so you can keep flying without breaking the bank.

### Post-Warranty Support

Even after warranty expiration:
- Parts available at reasonable prices
- Technical support continues
- Community support via forums
- DIY repair guides available
- Fair pricing on repairs
