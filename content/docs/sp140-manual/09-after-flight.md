## Transport

When transporting the motor and frame, strap it securely in place from large movements. If traveling on bumpy roads, please store the battery upright or lay it flat on its side in its foam case.

**Do not transport the battery upside down.**
{{< /callout >}}

### Transport Guidelines

**Frame & Motor:**
- Secure frame to prevent movement
- Protect propeller (remove or cover)
- Keep electronics dry
- Avoid extreme temperatures

**Battery:**
- **Preferred**: Upright position in foam case
- **Acceptable**: Flat on its side in foam case
- **Never**: Upside down
- **Never**: Loose or unsecured

### Vehicle Transport

The SP140 fits in most vehicles when disassembled:
- Standard car trunks
- SUV cargo areas
- Van interiors
- Pickup truck beds (weather protection recommended)

See [Dimensions](../03-dimensions) for transport size specifications.

## Short- & Long-Term Storage

For long-term storage, store the entire paramotor in a cool, dry place. This helps prevent degradation of the fabrics in the harness and battery pack due to environmental factors.

### Optimal Storage Conditions

**For storage over one week:**

- **Temperature**: 10-25°C (50-77°F)
- **State of Charge**: 30-50% SOC
- **Humidity**: Low, away from high humidity
- **Location**: Cool, dry, indoor space

### Storage by Duration

**Short-Term (< 1 week):**
- Can store at any SOC above 20%
- Room temperature acceptable
- No special preparation needed

**Long-Term (> 1 week):**
- Charge/discharge to 30-50% SOC
- Store in temperature-controlled environment
- Check battery monthly (see maintenance schedule)

**Extended Storage (> 1 month):**
- 30-50% SOC critical
- Check battery every 2-3 weeks
- Consider disconnecting battery
- Store in climate-controlled space

## Cold Weather Operations

Operating in very cold environments (sub-0°C temperatures) is not a problem for the SP140. However, avoid storing the battery pack outside in those temperatures, as the battery pack's maximum energy output will be reduced if cooled to those temperatures.

### Cold Weather Guidelines

**Normal cold weather flying, even at -20°C, is fine** because:
- Internal heating of cells during use protects the battery
- Performance decrease only occurs during long-term cold storage
- Motor and ESC are rated for cold operation

**Before Cold Weather Flight:**
1. Store battery in warm environment before flight
2. Allow battery to warm to 10°C+ if possible
3. Expect slightly reduced capacity initially
4. Monitor battery temperature during flight

**After Cold Weather Flight:**
1. Bring battery inside promptly
2. Allow to warm to room temperature naturally
3. Do not charge while cold
4. Check for any frost or condensation

**Cold Storage Effects:**
- Reduced available capacity
- Slower discharge rates possible
- No permanent damage if not charged cold
- Normal operation resumes at room temperature

## Scheduled Maintenance

There's not much maintenance needed, as there are no motor rebuilds, oil changes, carb tuning, and essentially no moving parts, unlike a gas motor. A few things to keep an eye on below.

| Interval | Task |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Every Flight** | Inspect bolts, straps, propeller for any marks or chips |
| **Every 3 Weeks** | Inspect the battery pack using the app to connect and ensure the cell voltages are not below 3.3v. If they have dropped below that threshold, charge them to 3.8v for long-term storage. |

### Pre-Flight Inspection (Every Flight)

**Frame & Structure:**
- Check all bolts for tightness
- Inspect frame for cracks or damage
- Verify hoop connectors are secure
- Check netting for tears or wear

**Propeller:**
- Inspect for chips, cracks, or damage
- Check mounting bolts
- Verify quick-release mechanism
- Look for balance issues

**Harness:**
- Inspect straps for wear
- Check buckles and fasteners
- Verify attachment points
- Test safety release

**Electrical:**
- Check connectors for corrosion
- Verify cables are secure
- Inspect hand controller
- Test power on/off

### Battery Maintenance (Every 3 Weeks)

Use the [OpenPPG app](../04-app) to:

1. **Connect to battery via Bluetooth**
2. **Check cell voltages**:
   - All cells should be > 3.3V
   - Cells should be balanced (within 0.05V)
3. **If any cell < 3.3V**:
   - Charge immediately to 3.8V minimum
   - Do not store below 3.3V
4. **Check for alerts or warnings**
5. **Log battery health data**

### Long-Term Maintenance

**Annually:**
- Deep inspection of all components
- Check for wear on moving parts
- Inspect electrical connections
- Update firmware if available
- Professional inspection recommended

**As Needed:**
- Replace damaged propeller
- Replace worn straps
- Repair damaged netting
- Update software/firmware

## Battery Care

### Charging Best Practices

- Charge in temperature-controlled environment (10-30°C)
- Use only OpenPPG-approved charger
- Do not leave unattended while charging
- Stop charging if battery becomes hot
- Store charger in dry location

### Battery Health

**Monitor via OpenPPG App:**
- Cell balance
- Total cycles
- Capacity degradation
- Temperature history
- Voltage trends

**Signs of Battery Issues:**
- Cells not balancing
- Rapid voltage drop
- Excessive heat
- Reduced capacity
- Physical damage

**If Issues Detected:**
- Contact OpenPPG support: info@openppg.com
- Do not fly with damaged battery
- Follow warranty procedures if applicable

## Cleaning & Care

### Frame & Components
- Wipe down with damp cloth
- Remove dirt and debris
- Avoid high-pressure water
- Dry thoroughly after cleaning
- Inspect while cleaning

### Electronics
- Keep dry
- Protect from dust
- Do not submerge
- Use electronics cleaner if needed
- Check for corrosion

### Propeller
- Clean with mild soap and water
- Inspect for damage while cleaning
- Dry completely
- Check balance after cleaning
- Store in protective case

## Record Keeping

Maintain records of:
- Flight hours
- Battery cycles
- Maintenance performed
- Issues encountered
- Repairs completed

Use the OpenPPG app for automatic logging of:
- Flight time
- Battery usage
- System alerts
- Maintenance reminders

## When to Seek Professional Service

Contact OpenPPG support if you experience:
- Persistent system alerts
- Battery issues
- Structural damage

## Advantages of Electric Maintenance

Unlike gas paramotors, the SP140 requires:
- **No oil changes**
- **No spark plug replacement**
- **No carburetor tuning**
- **No engine rebuilds**
- **No fuel system maintenance**
- **No exhaust system service**

This makes the SP140 one of the lowest-maintenance paramotors available.
