## 9.1 Transport
When transporting the motor and frame strap it securely in place from large movements.  If traveling on bumpy road please store the battery upright or lay it flat on its side in its foam case. **Do not transport the battery upside down.**

## 9.2 Short- & Long-Term Storage
For long-term storage, store the entire paramotor in a cool, dry place. This helps prevent degradation of the fabrics in the harness and battery pack due to environmental factors. For optimal long-term storage (over one week), store the battery pack **at 10-25°C, with a state of charge (SOC) between 30-50%, and away from high humidity.**

Operating in very cold environments (sub-0°C temperatures) is not a problem for the SP140. However, avoid storing the battery pack outside in those temperatures, as the battery pack's maximum energy output will be reduced if cooled to those temperatures. Normal cold weather flying, even at -20°C, is fine, as the internal heating of the cells during use will protect the battery pack. The performance decrease only occurs during long-term storage in cold environments.

## 9.4 Scheduled Maintenance
There's little maintenance needed, as there are no motor rebuilds, oil changes, carburetor tuning, and essentially no moving parts, unlike a gasoline motor. There are a few things to keep an eye on below:

| Interval | Task |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Every flight** | Inspect bolts, straps, propeller for any marks or chips |
| **Every 3 weeks** | Inspect the battery pack using the app to connect to and insure the cell voltages are not below 3.3v if they have dropped below that threshold please charge them until 3.8v for long term storage. |
